# Pecking Order

The pecking order is a social hierarchy within the flock. When new chickens are introduced to each other, their instinct is to establish this order. It determines each chickenâ€™s status in the flock through aggressive behaviors such as pecking, chasing, and fighting. This ensures the stability of the group by determining each chicken's status.

The pecking order is vital for maintaining order and reducing conflict within the flock. It establishes a ranking system, with the most dominant chickens at the top and the submissive ones at the bottom. This hierarchy decides how resources are distributed, such as food, water, and perching spaces.

Usually, roosters are at the highest positions in the pecking order, followed by the hens. Chickens at the top of the hierarchy have privileges such as first access to food, more choices with nesting spots, and the ability to mate with preferred partners.

Establishing the pecking order can sometimes be a stressful and violent process, but when established, it helps maintain peace within the flock. It is recommended to add some extra vitamins or vetRx as it can be very stressful for your flock. When it's all over, the chickens learn to respect the established statuses, reducing the frequency of conflicts in the future and ensuring the structural functions of the flock.
