# Flock Communication: Chicken Body & Verbal Meanings

Like all animals, chickens have developed their special way of communicating and interacting with each other within the flock. This communication is a combination of body language and vocalizations.

## Body Language

### Raised Feathers

Chickens can position their feathers in a variety of ways to express themselves. Raised feathers or “fluffed up” is usually a sign that a chicken is feeling threatened or is in a defensive posture. A chicken with smooth, and relaxed feathers is a calm and content chicken. If a chicken’s feathers are tightly closed against its body, it feels scared or that they feel they are in dangerous position/situation.

### Wing Movement

Wing movements are also a part of chicken communication. Flapping wings can mean different emotions such as excitement, dominance, and aggression. Roosters flare their wings and strut to impress hens or challenge rivals. This is a way to assert dominance in the flock.

### Head Movements

Very Sudden, and fast head movements with freezing up can indicate that a chicken senses danger and is on high alert. This is a instinctual behavior as it helps chickens figure out what their next actions should be for this potential danger.

## Vocalizations

### Clucking

Chickens use clucking to communicate with the flock, a ton of gentle clucks is just them chatting with other chickens, or can be providing reassurence to possible chicks that theyre there.

### Crowing

Roosters are known for crowing in the morning, which yes, they crow for signaling its daytime, but it can also be for marking territory, aswell as a alert system to alert the flock to potential dangers such as predators they may see. 

### Alarm Calls

Whenever a chicken senses dangers near, they will sound a sharp and repetitive sound to warn the rest of the flock of the potential danger, this call is typically done by roosters and rarely by hens, unless they have chicks and they're brooding.

### “Egg song”

Hens typically cluck loudly after laying an egg. This vocalization is known as the “egg song” because it's to let everyone know the hen has laid an egg. It can also attract other hens to the nest sometimes. Some think it’s also an expression of relief after laying an egg.

### Purring

Chickens can make purring sounds just like cats whenever they’re happy, they usually do this during social interactions whether its chickens or humans. Purring is a sign your chicken is relaxed and very comfortable.
